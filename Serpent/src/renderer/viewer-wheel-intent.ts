/**
 * Classify a wheel event on the viewer stage as a zoom or a pan intent
 * (Serpent-yo0n / Serpent-4kg3).
 *
 * A physical mouse wheel should zoom (anchored at the pointer); a trackpad
 * two-finger scroll should keep panning, and a trackpad pinch should zoom.
 * Browsers do not expose the device directly, so this uses the standard
 * heuristic stack:
 *
 * - ctrlKey/metaKey: Chromium reports trackpad pinch gestures as wheel
 *   events with ctrlKey set; Ctrl+wheel is also the explicit zoom chord.
 *   Exception (Serpent-4kg3): when the delta is primarily horizontal,
 *   Chromium sometimes still sets ctrlKey during a two-finger slide.
 *   Those events must pan/swipe, not zoom — real pinch and Ctrl+wheel
 *   produce a dominant vertical delta.
 * - deltaMode LINE/PAGE: only discrete devices (mouse wheels) report
 *   non-pixel modes.
 * - Fractional pixel deltas: only high-resolution trackpads produce
 *   sub-pixel values.
 * - Large integer pixel deltas (>= MOUSE_NOTCH_THRESHOLD): Chrome reports a
 *   mouse notch as roughly 100–150px per tick; trackpad scroll deltas are
 *   smaller and continuous.
 *
 * Known trade-off: a mouse with driver-level smooth scrolling (small pixel
 * deltas) is read as a trackpad and pans instead of zooming. The threshold
 * is exported so tests document the boundary.
