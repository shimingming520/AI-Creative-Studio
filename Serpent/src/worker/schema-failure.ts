/**
 * Serpent-verg.5 — migration failure diagnosis and retry (0031 §2.2).
 *
 * A failed migration rolls back (per-migration transaction) leaving the
 * library intact at its previous version, but blindly retrying forever would
 * spin the open path on a library that can never migrate. This module keeps
 * a `.serpent/migration-failed.json` record per library: the open path reads
 * it before migrating, retries with a 3-attempt cap, and after the cap opens
 * the library writable at the last good schema version instead of throwing.
 *
 * verifyMigrationHistory failures (checksum mismatch = damaged history) are
 * NOT recorded here: they stay LIBRARY_CORRUPT and are never retried.
