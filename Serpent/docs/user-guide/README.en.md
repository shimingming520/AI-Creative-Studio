## Quick start

1. Install Serpent (see [Install](installation.en.md))
2. Launch the app and create a local library
3. Drag images, videos, audio, 3D models, or text into the window, or click Import
4. Assets appear on the canvas. Double-click to open the viewer; right-click for more actions. Thumbnails, metadata, and AI analysis complete progressively in the background

Data stays in your local library directory; for syncing across machines, use WebDAV cloud sync (see [Sync](sync.en.md)).

## Interface at a glance

A typical workspace has library navigation on the left, the asset canvas in the center, and the Inspector on the right. On Windows, the upper-left Main menu contains File, Edit, Window, Library, and Settings; macOS also exposes the same commands in the native menu. Import, search, filtering, and sorting stay in the top toolbar.
