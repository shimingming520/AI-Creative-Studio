</div>

Open-source (MIT), cross-platform (macOS / Windows) digital asset manager for game artists, film and post-production teams, and designers.

[Homepage](https://serpent.dolag.work) · [Online docs](https://serpent.dolag.work/docs/user-guide/) · [Latest release](https://github.com/dolag233/Serpent/releases) · [Browser extension](https://github.com/dolag233/Serpent-Extension/releases)

Import, browse, search, tag, collect, preview 3D models (FBX/OBJ/GLB and more), and render with HDRI environment lighting and PBR. Data stays in a local library — no cloud dependency.

## Features

+ **Massive asset support.** Most video, image, and audio formats, plus 3D models and text assets.
+ **Asset management.** Tags, ratings, descriptions, fast filtering and search, and collections.
+ **Plugin system.** Extend Serpent with plugins.
+ **Scripting & MCP.** Control Serpent with scripts, and let agents connect and automate through MCP.
+ **AI analysis.** Built-in AI module analyzes images, videos, and 3D assets.
+ **WebDAV cloud sync.** Two-way library sync across machines, with auto-sync and a configurable poll interval.
+ **External libraries.** Open Eagle / Billfish libraries directly and browse and search them seamlessly after conversion.

## Install

Download the latest installer from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/dolag233/Serpent/releases).

**macOS**: download `Serpent-<version>-arm64.dmg` and drag it into Applications. On first launch macOS shows "cannot verify the developer" — right-click the app → Open (first time only), or run:

```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/Serpent.app
```

**Windows**: run `Serpent-<version> Setup.exe`. Unsigned builds show a SmartScreen warning on first run — choose "More info → Run anyway".

**Browser extension**: download it from the [browser extension releases](https://github.com/dolag233/Serpent-Extension/releases). Open `chrome://extensions`, enable Developer mode, and load the unpacked extension:

- macOS: `Serpent.app/Contents/Resources/extension`
- Windows: `resources/extension` in the install directory

## Build locally

Requires Node.js 24.15.0 (see `.nvmrc`). Native development targets are macOS arm64 and Windows x64. Do not build from an SMB/NAS-mounted path.

```bash
npm ci --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org
npm run rebuild:native   # align better-sqlite3 with Electron's ABI (verifies FTS5)
npm start
```

Common commands:

```bash
npm run lint             # ESLint
npm run typecheck        # tsc --noEmit
npm run test             # unit + worker integration tests
npm run test:e2e         # Playwright E2E
npm run package          # package to out/Serpent-<platform>-<arch>/
npm run make             # build platform installers (macOS dmg / Windows zip; Windows setup via Inno Setup)
```

The full build, packaging and release flow is in the [developer docs](docs/developer/build-packaging.en.md).
